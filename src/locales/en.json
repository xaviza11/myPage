    "description": "I am a developer passionate about creating modern and functional applications, with experience in both frontend and backend technologies. I’ve been interested in programming for a long time, so I completed a short bootcamp. Afterward, since I didn’t feel fully prepared, I continued studying independently. I learned Python and some Rust. I am eager to work as a programmer and am proficient across the entire stack, both frontend and backend. On the frontend, my favorite technologies are React and Vue. For the backend, I prefer Next.js for its structure and Fastify for its performance."
